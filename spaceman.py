'''
Read word from other file, is now the secret word

Display empty spaces for each letter of word and a blank list of letters guesssed

Prompt user for letter, check to make sure only lower case letters are inputted
First check length is only 1 character then try to find it in ascii_lowercase
If input is valid check secret word if it has those letters
Remove the letter from a list of all ascii_lowercase

Do above until all letters in word are guessed or 7 incorrect guesses are made

List of guessed letters can be made from ascii_lowercase then removing each guessed letter
